# A Wordle Without Z

A clone of the popular Wordle game by Josh Wardle. This version eliminates the letter Z and provides some extra information.

## FAQ

### Why?
Because there are big tanks - tanks emblazened with the letter 'Z' - that are causing a lot of destruction. The drivers are told they are fighting for a just cause. The truth is blocked by their government. People are choosing to fight because they believe the lies. All foreign and independent media has been banned.

This app helps those people find a way around this new iron curtain so they can hear from the rest of the world. Maybe then they can hear the truth. And if they know the truth, maybe they won't join the fight.

### How do you play the game?
Each day a different 5-letter secret word is chosen. You have 6 chances to guess the word. After each guess, you will receive clues. Blue tiles are correct. Yellow tiles indicate correct letters are in the wrong position.

### What information is in the app?
There are 3 basic sections:
* Connecting to the Internet through a firewall using VPNs and the Tor network, and how to connect with the Tor browser and Tails.
* Onion site (hidden service) links for foreign sites and social media that has been blocked. These are notoriously cumbersome to remember and type in.
* Shortwave radio frequencies and program times for media networks. Many news outlets still broadcast their programming worldwide.

### Why not add information on how to help organizations, provide aid, etc?
There will always be too many things to list. The information here is just to help people get *to* the other information out there. That's where the good stuff is.

## Known Issues
* If a letter only occurs once but is entered in both a correct and incorrect location, a tile will turn yellow when it shouldn't.
* Menu icons and information modals have not been added yet.
* A favicon is needed.



## Planned updates
* Convert to a progressive web app so it can be shared easily and run locally on desktops and mobile devices.
* Continuing improvements to user interface and scaling.
