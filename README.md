# A Wordle Without Z

A clone of the popular Wordle game by Josh Wardle. This version eliminates the letter Z and helps get information through the new Iron Curtain.

## FAQ
### Why?
Because Wordle is a very simple and fun game. And because information needs to be free.

### Background
Ukraine is under attack in a brutal invasion. The aggressor has been telling its conscripted troops that they are just going to a "special military operation" and that their is no war.

The world knows different, but now Russia has cut its citizens off from the world. All non-state-owned media has been shuttered. Increasingly larger portions oif the Internet are being blocked, including all news sites and social media. Protesters are dealt with swiftly.

The result: People hear only the official story. The word "war" is banned. Fewer people believe there even is a war. Protests dwindle. A pro-government movement develops and gets bigger every day.

This pro-government, pro-war movement has chosen the letter **Z** as its symbol. Originally, it was written on tanks. Then as grafitti. Now it has an official logo and appears on clothing, signs, bumper-stickers, etc. 

### App benefits
The main menu of the app provides information on getting connected to the Internet through the government firewall using VPNs and Tor. It also provides frequencies and times of international shortwave news broadcasts.

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) and can be installed locally on Windows, Mac, Android, Chrome, iOS, and Samsung devices without using app stores, so all information from will still be available without an Internet connection.

Hopefully, if more people know the truth fewer will support the war.

## The game
The play is simple:
* Each day you get a different 5-letter secret word to solve.
* You have 6 chances to guess the word.
* All guesses must be valid 5-letter words.
* After each guess, you will receive clues.
* * Blue tiles are correct.
* * Yellow tiles show letters that are in the wrong position.

### What information is in the app?
There are 3 basic sections:
* Connecting to the Internet through a firewall using VPNs and the Tor network, and how to connect with the Tor browser and Tails.
* Onion site (hidden service) links for foreign sites and social media that has been blocked. These are notoriously cumbersome to remember and type in.
* * The links can be copied to the clipboard for viewing in a Tor browser.
* * When viewing the site from a Tor browser, the links can be followed directly.
* Shortwave radio frequencies and program times for media networks. Many news outlets still broadcast their programming worldwide.

### Why not add information on how to help organizations, provide aid, etc?
There will always be too many things to list. The information here is just to help people get *to* the other information out there. That's where the good stuff is.
