    <h3>About</h3>
    
    <p>Wordle is a simple guessing game. Every day there is a new secret word to guess. You get 6 guesses. If you win, you can celebrate! If not, you can always try again tomorrow.</p>

    <p>You may have noticed that this version of the game doesn't include the letter "Z" and the corresponding keycap has been replaced by a Ukrainian flag...</p>
    
    <p>If you are in a country with a "special military operation" in the west, where all non-state-owned media has been shut down, where many foreign sites in the Internet have been blocked, and where there is a growing pro-war movement united behind the letter Z, then this app is for you.</p>

    <p>In addition to the word game, you will find information and links to access blocked news and websites. If you install this locally <button class="install-button">⬇️</button> as an app, you will have access to that information even without an Internet connection. No app store is required.</p>

    <p>Please use the links and information in this app to break through the new iron curtain and hear what the rest of the world is trying to tell you. And please don't join the Z movement.</p>
