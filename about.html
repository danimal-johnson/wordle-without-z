    <h3>About</h3>
    
    <p>Wordle is a simple guessing game. Every day there is a new secret word to guess. You get 6 guesses. If you win, you can celebrate! If not, you can always try again tomorrow.</p>

    <p>You may have noticed that this version of the game doesn't include the letter "Z" and the corresponding keycap has been replaced by a Ukrainian flag...</p>
    
    <p>This is not by accident. If you are in a country with a "special military operation" in the west, and where there is a growing pro-war movement and supporters are often found showing the letter Z, then this app is for you.</p>

    <p>Your government has shut down all non-state-owned media and blocked foreign media sites (including social media) on the Internet. With the information controlled, it can tell whatever story it wants the people to believe.</p>

    <p>Please use the links and information in this app to get through this information firewall and hear what the rest of the world is trying to tell you. And please don't join the Z movement.</p>
