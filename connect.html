<h3>Connecting to the Internet / Bypassing Blocking</h3>

<p>
    If you've been blocked from international access to parts of the Internet, there are a few ways to get around this. A few of the most popular options are using a VPN, using a Tor browser on your computer or mobile device, or using an operating system like Tails for even more anonymity.
</p>

<h4>VPNs</h4>
<p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) allows you to connect to the Internet through a service. Once you are connected, it appears that all your traffic is going to a local server. Meanwhile, the VPN is routing the data through its internal network to another country of your choice.</p>

<p>The limitations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Not anonymous. Services may be forced to send your network activity to the government.</li>
    <li>International companies may be subject to sanctions and stop operating (either by your own government, or another).</li>
    <li>Most VPNs are paid services. If international payment gateways (like SWIFT) are shut down, a VPN may close your account for non-payment.</li>    
</ul>

<p>A couple of free alternatives exist (both supported by the <a href="https://www.opentech.fund/">Open Technology Fund</a>): <a href="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dwo-jar-kmf-883/download.html">nthLink</a> and <a href="https://psiphon.ca/">Psiphon.</a> You can find some more detailed instructions (in Russian) and a few more free options <a href="https://d3olbu2cl74039.cloudfront.net/block">here</a>.</p>

<h4>The Tor Network</h4>

<p>The Tor network is a virtual network that provides anonymity through the Internet. All traffic is passed through 3 different nodes in a protocol called onion routing.</p>

<p>The easiest and most common way to connect is by using a Tor browser. Opening the browser will create a "Tor circuit" and begin routing all your traffic through its network. You can then browse the web as usual, or visit .onion links like the ones shown on the Links tab of this app.</p>

<h5>Downoading the Tor Browser</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Windows, MacOS, Android, Linux: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download">torproject.org</a></li>
    <li>iOS: <a href="https://onionbrowser.com/">onionbrowser.com</a></li>
    <li>Send an empty email to <a href="mailto:gettor@torproject.org">gettor@torproject.org</a></li> to receive a browser bundle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes even the Tor network will be blocked. This can sometimes be bypassed with a bridge. To use a bridge, you will have to obtain a link and then enter it into your Tor browser. Find a link in one of these ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Send "/bridges" to the Telegram channel @GetBridgesBot</li>
    <li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:bridges@torproject.org">bridges@torproject.org</a></li>
    <li>Select a built-in bridge through Snowflake in the Tor browser.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Tails</h4>

<p><a href="Tails">Tails</a> is a portable operating system that you boot from a thumb drive or DVD. It uses Tor by default, can run on almost any computer, doesn't need to be installed, and leaves no trace when you are finished with it.</p>

<p>It's a great tool for avoiding censorship, communicating securely, publishing sensitive information, and avoiding surveillance.</p>
